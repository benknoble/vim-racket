# vim-racket

Installation
------------

This module works with native packages and many Vim plugin managers. To use with
pathogen, type the following into a terminal:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/benknoble/vim-racket.git

Re-open your file(s) and benefit from the features of _vim-racket_.

Pairs well with
[rparen.vim](https://gist.github.com/plane/8c872ed174ba4f026b95ea8eb934cead), a
global mapping on `]` to insert the right closer. [Here is one updated version
of the same
script](https://github.com/benknoble/Dotfiles/blob/master/links/vim/autoload/rparen.vim)

## Thanks

This version is an updated fork of
[wlangstroth/vim-racket](https://github.com/wlangstroth/vim-racket) with

Most of the real work on this module was done by [Dale
