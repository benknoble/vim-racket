# vim-racket

Installation
------------

This module works with native packages and many Vim plugin managers. To use with
pathogen, type the following into a terminal:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/benknoble/vim-racket.git

Re-open your file(s) and benefit from the features of _vim-racket_.

Pairs well with
[rparen.vim](https://gist.github.com/plane/8c872ed174ba4f026b95ea8eb934cead), a
global mapping on `]` to insert the right closer.
